    <h2 class="f2">Repositories</h2>

    <p class="pmax">A repository is essentially a project. You can imagine it as a project's folder with all the related files inside of it.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses</h2>

    <p class="pmax">A readme explains what the project is, how to use it, and often times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file, CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">A .gitignore is a list of files that Git should not track, for instance, files with passwords.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">A license file is the type of license you put on your project, information on the types is <a href="http://choosealicense.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="f1">Remotes</h2>

    <h2 class="f2">Connect your Local to your Remote</h2>

    <p class="pmax">At the top of GitHub you'll see 'Quick Setup', make sure the 'HTTP' button is selected and copy the address - this is the location (address) of your repository on GitHub's servers.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">You can have multiple remotes so each requires a name. For your main one, this is commonly named 'origin'.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Your local repository now knows where your remote one named 'origin' lives on GitHub's servers. Think of it as adding a name and address on speed dial - now when you need to send something there, you can.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Push work to your Remote</h2>

    <p class="pmax">By default the first branch is named 'master'. When you push (and later pull) from a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the name of the remote that it lives on.</p>

    <h2 class="f1">Forks and Clones</h2>

    <p class="pmax">When you fork a repository, you're creating a copy of it on your GitHub account. Your fork begins its life as a remote repository. Forks are used for creating your own version of a project or contributing back fixes or features to the original project.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Once a project is forked, you then clone (aka copy) it from GitHub to your computer to work on locally.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Clone Fork Locally</h2>

    <p class="pmax">Now, in terminal, clone the repository onto your computer. It will create a new folder for the repository so no need to create one. But make sure you aren't cloning it inside of another Git respoitory folder!</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Connect to the Original Repository</h2>

    <p class="pmax">But what if the original repository you forked from changes? You'll want to be able to pull in those changes too. So let's add another remote connection, this time to the original repository with its URL, found on the right hand side of the original on GitHub.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">You can name this remote connection anything you want, but often people use 'upstream'.</p>
