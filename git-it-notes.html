    <h2 class="f2">Repositories</h2>

    <p class="pmax">A repository is essentially a project. You can imagine it as a project's folder with all the related files inside of it.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses</h2>

    <p class="pmax">A readme explains what the project is, how to use it, and often times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file, CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">A .gitignore is a list of files that Git should not track, for instance, files with passwords.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">A license file is the type of license you put on your project, information on the types is <a href="http://choosealicense.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Connect your Local to your Remote</h2>

    <p class="pmax">At the top of GitHub you'll see 'Quick Setup', make sure the 'HTTP' button is selected and copy the address - this is the location (address) of your repository on GitHub's servers.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">You can have multiple remotes so each requires a name. For your main one, this is commonly named 'origin'.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Your local repository now knows where your remote one named 'origin' lives on GitHub's servers. Think of it as adding a name and address on speed dial - now when you need to send something there, you can.</p>

    <h2 class="f2">Push work to your Remote</h2>

    <p class="pmax">By default the first branch is named 'master'. When you push (and later pull) from a project, you tell Git the branch name you want and the name of the remote that it lives on.</p>
