    <h1 class="mega">Notes on GitHub Guides</h1>

    <h4 class="f4"><a href="https://guides.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Guides</a></h4>

    <p class="pmax">This is a collection of brief notes culled from the GitHub Guides. While they are all quite short tutorials (a 3 - 10 minute read each), particularly worth checking out are <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html" target="_blank">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/" target="_blank">Getting Started with GitHub Pages</a>, and <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/" target="_blank">Mastering Issues</a>.</p>

    <!-- Understanding the GitHub Flow  -->
    <h2 class="f1"><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html" target="_blank">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a></h2>

    <h3 class="f2">Create a branch</h3>

    <p class="pmax">When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the <span class="code-span">master</span> branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub Flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the <span class="code-span">master</span> branch is always deployable.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix. Your branch name should be descriptive (e.g., <span class="code-span">refactor-authentication</span>, <span class="code-span">user-content-cache-key</span>, <span class="code-span">make-retina-avatars</span>), so that others can see what is being worked on.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">Add commits</h3>

    <p class="pmax">Each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">Open a Pull Request</h3>

    <p class="pmax">You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">Discuss and review your code</h3>

    <p class="pmax">Pull Request comments are written in Markdown, so you can embed images and emoji, use pre-formatted text blocks, and other lightweight formatting.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">Deploy</h3>

    <p class="pmax">Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing master into production.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">Merge</h3>

    <p class="pmax">Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">By incorporating certain keywords into the text of your Pull Request, you can associate issues with code. When your Pull Request is merged, the related issues are also closed. For example, entering the phrase <span class="code-span">Closes #32</span> would close issue number 32 in the repository.</p>

    <!-- Mastering Issues -->
    <h2 class="f1"><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/" target="_blank">Mastering Issues</a></h2>

    <p class="pmax">A <strong>milestone</strong> acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. <em>Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16</em> or <em>Shipping 1.0</em>).</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">One assignee is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Comments allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.</p>

    <h3 class="f2">References</h3>

    <p class="pmax">You can reference issues by typing in a hashtag plus the issue number.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Issue in another repository? Just include the repository before the name like: <span class="code-span">kneath/example-project#42</span></p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">One of the more interesting ways to use GitHub Issues is to reference issues directly from commits. Include the issue number inside of the commit message.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">By prefacing your commits with <span class="code-span">Fixes</span>, <span class="code-span">Fixed</span>, <span class="code-span">Fix</span>, <span class="code-span">Closes</span>, <span class="code-span">Closed</span>, or <span class="code-span">Close</span> when the commit is merged into master, it will also automatically close the issue.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">References make it possible to deeply connect the work being done with the bug being tracked, and are a great way to add visibility into the history of your project.</p>

    <!-- Mastering Markdown -->
    <h2 class="f1"><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/" target="_blank">Mastering Markdown</a></h2>

    <p class="pmax">You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:</p>

    <p class="pmax">
      <ul>
        <li>Gists</li>
        <li>Commends in Issues and Pull Requests</li>
        <li>Files with the <span class="code-span">.md</span> or <span class="code-span">.markdown</span> extension</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="pmax">If you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will get a handy progress indicator in your issue list. It also works in Pull Requests!</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens <span class="code-span">-</span> (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe <span class="code-span">|</span>.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Any reference to a commitâ€™s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">Any URL (like <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank">http://www.github.com/</a>) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.</p>

    <br>

    <p class="pmax">GitHub supports <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/" target="_blank">emoji</a>!</p>
